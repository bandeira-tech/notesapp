we are going to create a notebook app on top of b3nd using b3nd sdk
this is to be the canonical b3nd firecat note taking app
the idea is that it's a simple super focused app
users signup using b3nd wallet client
signedup users can create notebooks with a title, cover and visibility (private, protected, public)
notebooks are streams of pages, it's main page is a desc timeline with the posts
the author sees the form on top where they can very easily post many posts one after another as they line up below
they can also post images
public notebooks are listed in an index page where other users can find them and read them
users can click on action on a notebook page to post in place on their target notebook with a reference to that page
people can like and comment on pages/posts, likes show up discreetly on the post along with comment numbers, and to see comments you have to click through
we should be able to get links to the posts and share that which is then shown independently but with navigation tio the original notebook timeline
the design should allow for a command line tool that would be connect just the same and sharing code as much as possible, as well as a browser plugin for chromeo
instead of comments though we call them reactions, and we make it very easy for multimedia reactions, from emoji to text, to image and so on
the primary case for the notebooks is microblogging, self-reporting, and thought dump, and then can be shared as platform for social interaction
this is an open source freemium app for easy and delightful notetaking and optional social sharing in a decentralized network
beautiful peaceful and customizable spaces for posting and keeping data in a trustworthy network
using good cryptography and secure, safe implementation
